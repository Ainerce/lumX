## <a name="code-of-conduct"></a> Code of Conduct

As heavy users of [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/angular), we encourage you to read and follow the [Angular Code of Conduct](https://github.com/angular/code-of-conduct/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## <a name="got-a-question-or-a-problem-"></a> Got a question or a problem?

If you have questions about how to use LumBoilerplate, please direct these to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lumboilerplate).

## <a name="found-an-issue-"></a> Found an issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lumapps/boilerplate/issues). Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

Please see the Submission Guidelines below.

## <a name="want-a-feature-"></a> Want a feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is, discuss it with us before hand in your issue, so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

- **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
- **LumBoilerplate Version(s)** - is it a regression?
- **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only IE8?
- **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit) or [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/)) or a unambiguous set of steps.

### Submitting a pull request

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/lumapps/boilerplate/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request
that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Make your changes in a new git branch

```shell
git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
```

* Create your patch.
* Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
[commit message conventions](#commit-message-format).
* Check and test your changes locally.

```shell
npm run lint:all && npm run tests
```

* Push your branch to GitHub:

```shell
git push origin my-fix-branch
```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `boilerplate:master`.
* If we suggest changes then
* Make the required updates.
* Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

```shell
git rebase master -i
git push -f
```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

```shell
git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
```

* Check out the master branch:

```shell
git checkout master -f
```

* Delete the local branch:

```shell
git branch -D my-fix-branch
```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

```shell
git pull --ff upstream master
```

## <a name="coding-rules"></a> Coding rules

We're using Javascript and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) to build the framework. We're also using NPM and Wepack to help you contribute:

- `npm start` will build the project, watch for modifications (with hot-reload) and serve an example application.
- `npm run lint:all` will check the coding style and lint all your configs and source files
- `npm run tests` will run all unit and E2E tests and produce reports (available in `tests/client/(unit|e2e)/report`)
- `npm run build:prod` will update the dist folder with the last contents and make a production ready package.
- Many other NPM command are available. Use `npm run help` to get a list of all available tasks

Our coding convention is the following:

- 4 spaces for indentation, for Javascript and SCSS.
- Wrap all codes at 120 characters.

For Javascript:

- Use camel-case.
- Use the [One True Brace Style (1TBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#1TBS).

For SCSS:

- Except for the line wrap, please refer to [the Harry Roberts css guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es/).
- For the CSS properties, we follow the [concentric order](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2011/concentric-css/)

For the ease of use and contributing, most of the coding styles are enforced with ESLint and SASS-Lint. So as long as the pre-commit script let you commit, you should be good.

## <a name="git-commit-guidelines"></a> Git commit guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.

We recommend you to use [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) with the `npm run commit` command to help you construct your commit message and be sure to match these guidelines.

For the ease of use and contributing, most of the commit message style is enforced. So as long as the pre-commit script let you commit, you should be good.

### Commit message format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (gulp, npm, webpack, ...)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as distribution generation
* **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `notification', 'dropdown', etc.

### Body

The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
The breaking changes must be at the end of the commit with only "BROKEN:" before the list of breaking changes. They must be each on a new line.

### Commit example

```
feat TOTO: TOTO for all

Before we had to do XXX. There was this and this problem. Now, by using TOTO, it's simpler and the problems are managed.

Closes PR #25
Fix #15
BROKEN:
first thing broken
second thing broken
```
